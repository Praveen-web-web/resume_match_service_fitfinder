# 🧠 Resume Match Service – FitFinder

A modular, production-grade microservice for parsing resumes and matching them to job descriptions using configurable NLP pipelines. Built for seamless integration into FitFinder’s recruitment platform.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Resume Parsing**: Extracts structured data (name, email, location, summary, skills, certifications) using heading-based segmentation and regex/NLP.
- 🧠 **Match Scoring**: Computes semantic and keyword-based match scores against TRF schema or job descriptions.
- ⚙️ **Config-Driven Architecture**: Easily extendable via YAML/JSON configs for parsing rules, scoring weights, and schema mappings.
- 📤 **Triggerable Workflows**: Supports auto-notification, assessment triggers, and candidate shortlisting.
- 🧱 **Microservice Ready**: Designed for containerization, horizontal scaling, and plug-and-play integration.
